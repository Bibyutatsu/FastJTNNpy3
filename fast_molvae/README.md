# Accelerated Training of Junction Tree VAE
The MOSES dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/molecularsets/moses.

## Deriving Vocabulary
If you are running our code on a new dataset, you need to compute the vocabulary from your dataset.
To perform tree decomposition over a set of molecules, run
```
cd fast_jtnn
python mol_tree.py -i ./../../data/train.txt -v ./../../data/vocab.txt
```
This gives you the vocabulary of cluster labels over the dataset `train.txt`.

## Training
Step 1: Preprocess the data:
```
python preprocess.py --train ../data/train.txt --split 100 --jobs 40 --output ./moses-processed
```
This script will preprocess the training data (subgraph enumeration & tree decomposition), and save results into a list of files. We suggest you to use small value for `--split` if you are working with smaller datasets.

Step 2: Train VAE model with KL annealing.
```
python vae_train.py --train moses-processed --vocab ../data/vocab.txt --save_dir vae_model/
```
Default Options:

`--beta 0` means to set KL regularization weight (beta) initially to be zero.

`--warmup 40000` means that beta will not increase within first 40000 training steps. It is recommended because using large KL regularization (large beta) in the beginning of training is harmful for model performance.

`--step_beta 0.002 --kl_anneal_iter 1000` means beta will increase by 0.002 every 1000 training steps (batch updates). You should observe that the KL will decrease as beta increases.

`--max_beta 1.0 ` sets the maximum value of beta to be 1.0.

`--save_dir vae_model`: the model will be saved in vae_model/

Please note that this is not necessarily the best annealing strategy. You are welcomed to adjust these parameters.

## Testing
To sample new molecules with trained models, simply run
```
python sample.py --nsample 100 --vocab ../data/vocab.txt --hidden 450 --model vae_model/model.epoch-19 --output_file './sample.txt'
```

This script prints in each line the SMILES string of each molecule. `model.iter-400000` is a model trained with 400K steps with the default hyperparameters. This should give you the same samples as in [moses-h450z56/sample.txt](moses-h450z56/sample.txt). The result is as follows:
